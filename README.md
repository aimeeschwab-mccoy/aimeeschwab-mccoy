### Hiya!

My name is Aimee Schwab-McCoy, and I'll be a Lecturer in Population Health Informatics and Statistics at IT Sligo beginning in Fall 2021. 

Before that, I was an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science and the Data Science Program Director at Creighton University. I teach classes in statistics, biostatistics, data science, and machine learning.

Some projects I'm working on...

- Data science curriculum development 🏫
- Learning about statistical inference in introductory biostatistics 🧬
- Models for social distancing adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic 🦠
- Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in SAS PROC GLIMMIX ➡️ R 🖥
- Developing learnr tutorials for biostatistics and mathematical statistics 📊
- Consulting projects (a little of this, a little of that) 🐝🏥🥇

Some classes I taught at Creighton (and more importantly have GitHub repos for)...

- MTH 361: Probability and Statistics in the Health Science 💉
- MTH 362: Statistical Modeling 📚
- MTH 365: Introduction to Data Science 💻
- MTH 366: Machine Learning 🤖
- MTH 561: Mathematical Statistics I (Probability) 🎲

Course repos are currently set to private - email me if you'd like access!
